			<b></br>Tips for finding effective charities to donate to and general donation tips.</b>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Know what you want to change.</b></br>Don't respond to the first organization or person that appeals for help. Take the time to 
			identify which causes are most important to you and know specifically about what you are looking to change for the better.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Avoid telemarketing campaigns.</b></br>For-profit fundraisers, like charitable telemarketing campaigns, 
			keep a large portion (in some cases all) of each dollar they collect. 
			Never give out your personal information – like credit card accounts, social security numbers – over the phone. 
			If you like what you hear in the pitch, hang up, investigate the charity on-line or ask for written information 
			and send your contributions directly to the charity, so you can ensure 100% of their donation reaches the charity. 
			Consider supporting a charity that uses an inefficient telemarketing approach, 
			or a charity that does not use telemarketing to raise funds. </li></br>
			
			<li><b>Don't give in to pressure tactics.</b></br>Well-run charities don't use pressure tactics to garner support for their mission.
			They don't need to. Their good work and financial health speaks for itself.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Do not give just because you received a gift.</b></br>Just because you received a gift that doesn't mean you're
			required to reciprocate with a donation, and be especially wary of sweepstakes that require a contribution to enter. Reputable charities
			don't employ these inefficient and deceptive fundraising tactics.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Be Careful Of Charities with similar Names.</b></br>Take the time to uncover the difference between charities with similar names. 
			The names of some charities might be similar to each other but they may do completely different things.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Confirm 501(c) (3) Status.</b></br>Only support groups granted tax-exempt status under section 501(c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
			A U.S. nonprofit granted tax-exempt status means the group has filed paperwork with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and it allows donators to 
			take a tax-deduction for their donations. Charities not granted tax-exempt status could be from a scam artist.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Check The Charity's Accountability and Transparency.</b></br>Charities that follow good accountability and transparency practices 
			are less likely to engage in unethical or irresponsible activities. The risk that similar charities would misuse donations is lower 
			than for charities that don't follow such practices.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Obtain Copies Of A Charity's Financial Records.</b></br>The most efficient charities spend 75% or more of their budget
			on their programs and services and less than 25% on fundraising and administrative fees. A charity's ability to sustain its programs 
			over time is just as important as its short-term day-to-day operations. Seek out charities that are able to grow their revenue
			at least at the rate of inflation. The better charities also have some money saved for a rainy day. 
			Ask the charity for copies of its three most recent Forms 990. Not only can you examine the charity's finances, but also be able to assess
			its commitment to transparency by the charity's willingness to send the documents.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Review Executive Compensation.</b></br> Charities pay their leaders a competitive salary in order to attract and retain
			the kind of talent needed to run a multi-million dollar organization and produce results, but don't just take the CEO's salary 
			at face value. Check the salary against similar-sized organizations engaged in similar work and located in the same region of the country.
			Also exam the overall performance of the organization. It is better to contribute to a charity with a well-paid CEO that is meeting its 
			goals than to support a charity with an underpaid CEO that fails to deliver on its promises.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Learn about a charity's mission.</b></br>Talk with the charity to learn about its accomplishments, 
			goals and challenges, so you can see if their mission is something you want to help with. 
			Be prepared to walk away from any charity that is unable or unwilling to respond.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Concentrate Your Giving.</b></br> When you feel you are ready to donate then donate to as few charities as possible. 
			Spreading your money among multiple charities only diminishes the possibility of any of those groups bringing about any great change. 
			Charities use part of your gift on processing expenses for that gift so small amounts over many charities means a small change, 
			while concentrating the same amount to one or two charities means a bigger change.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Send your donation directly to the charity.</b></br>Never give your personal or credit card information to those initiating 
			contact. Send your contribution directly to the charity you wish to support. Don't send cash as it can be lost or stolen. 
			If you want to use you donations for a tax-deduction then paid by check or credit card so you have a receipt of your donation.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Verify a charity's claim that you've contributed in the past.</b></br>If any charity indicates that you've given in the past, 
			be sure to check it out for yourself. Look up previous entries in your checkbook or past credit card bills and confirm 
			for yourself that you've supported this particular charity before.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Tell the charity not to share your personal information.</b></br>When you send a charity a donation there is a possibility 
			that the organization will then sell or trade your contact information with other charities so the other charities can also solicit you.
			Tell the charity upfront that you do not want it to share your personal information with any other entity.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Share Your Intentions And Make A Long-Term Commitment.</b></br>A Long term donor can help charities more than a quick one time donor. 
			Don't hesitate to tell the charity of your giving plans so that the organization knows it can rely on you and the charity doesn't 
			have to waste resources and harass you by sending numerous solicitations.</li></br>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<b>Guide To Volunteering.</b>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Identify charities that match your charitable interests.</b></br>
			Determine what it is you want to accomplish and identifying charities that work to achieve those goals.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Examine their financial health.</b></br>Do you want to donate your time to a charity that is fiscally efficient, or 
			do you want to help a charity whose revenue hasn't grown as quickly as the need of its programs and is in need of 
			volunteer assistance until it can hire more staff. Find out which type is more important to you and find charities that match.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Evaluate their programs.</b></br>Filter out any charities that can't clearly communicate their mission, goals, accomplishments 
			and challenges, and continue to do so until you are left with a list of exceptional charities for whom you'd be proud to work for.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Quantify and qualify what you can offer.</b></br>Finally, contact your list of potential charities to find out what they are looking for 
			in a volunteer and see if your skills match those needs. You might be asked to stop in for an interview and you may be required to undergo training
			once you are accepted into their program. 
			It's a good idea to conduct a self-assessment to know your personal goals before you meet with the charity.
			Be sure you can answer the following questions so you can know what you want and what you have to offer the charity:
			<ul>
				<li>How much time can I realistically give in a week, month or year?</li>
				<li>What days of the week and time of day am I available to volunteer?</li>
				<li>What unique talents do I possess that would help this charity achieve its mission?</li>
				<li>What tasks am I unable or not willing to do?</li>
				<li>What do I hope to gain from the experience?</li>
				<li>Do I want to develop a new skill set that would be transferable to the workplace?</li>
				<li>Do I want to meet new people with similar interests?</li>
				<li>Do I just want the gratifying feeling of helping?</li>
			</ul>
			</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Make a commitment.</b></br>Showing up late, cancelling at the last minute, and performing poorly, costs an organization's time, money, 
			and prevents it from fulfilling its mission. A reliable volunteer with a strong work ethic can go a long way towards helping a charity meet its 
			goals. If you made any commitments with an organization then follow through with it, because the organization has made an investment in you 
			and is depending on you to contribute back.</li></br>
			</ul>
			</p>
			
			
			
			<p>
			<b>Guide to Donating Noncash Items.</b>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Determine whether or not the items you wish to donate are useful.</b></br>Most charities can only make use of items that are new,
			unused, or nearly new. If you don't have any use for what you think you are going to donate or it is too worn for you to use,
			chances are neither will a charity.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Consider selling your items and donating the proceeds to charity.</b></br>Donating cash instead of goods allows
			charities greater flexibility in spending the money so that it reaches the people or animals that need it the most, and 
			eliminates anyone that could take away cut of the money intended for charity.
			Selling the items yourself saves the charities time and money and allows the 
			charities to spend more resources directly fulfilling their missions.
			You also will be able to know the exact value of the donation, so you can report to the IRS and don't have to 
			worry about estimating the amount for your tax returns.
			You can sell your goods online in places like eBay or Craigslist and you can also sell them at garage sales and swap meets.
			</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Start locally to find the right charity.</b></br>Donating non cash items to local charities means less money spent on travel expenses and 
			more money spent to fulfill their missions. Call around and ask charities if they accept the kind of items you are looking to donate, 
			and if they don't, then find out if they have any suggestions of any charity that does. 
			</li></br>
			
			<li><b>How do I establish the market value of used items I donate to charity?</b></br>When you give used clothes or other items to charity,
			the Internal Revenue Service allows you to deduct the fair market value of the items on your income tax return.
			The IRS is not able to tell you how much any of the items you donate are worth, but instead says that the fair market value 
			of anything you donate is the amount people would pay for the items at thrift shops or used clothing stores. 
			You can determine the size of the deduction to take by checking with local stores.</li></br>
			</ul>
			</p>
			
			
			
			<p>
			<b>Tips For Giving In Times Of Crisis.</b>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Give To An Established Charity.</b></br>Find a charity with a proven track record of success with dealing with the type of disaster 
			and in the region in which the disaster happened. Avoid charities made specifically to just deal with the new crisis. 
			Well-meaning new organizations will not have the infrastructure and knowledge of the region to efficiently use your gift. 
			Make sure that any charity new or old that you want to donate to is in fact a registered public charity with 501 (c) (3) status.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Designate Your Investment.</b></br>Most charities ask that you don't designate your gift so they can decide how best to use your gift, 
			but if you find a charity that will accept your opinion then you may be able to tell the charity exactly how to use your investment.
			By designating your gift, you will ensure that your gift will be used as you intended. Most charities that are online 
			offer a way to tell the organization how to spend your contribution and if you are mailing in a check, then write 
			a note in the memo section of the check specifying how you want it to be used.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Avoid Telemarketers.</b></br>Never donate money to anyone over the phone and never give your credit card information
			to anyone via the phone. Instead, ask the fundraiser to send you written information about the charity they represent 
			and do some research on your own. To make sure all of your gift goes directly to the charity of your choice send the organization a 
			check directly in the mail, or give directly through their website.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Do Not Send Supplies.</b></br>Please don't send food or supplies to disaster areas or areas in crisis, because in the impacted regions there 
			will most likely be no one there that will be able to receive, organize, and distribute them to the victims. Charities often partner with 
			companies to acquire large amounts of food, clothing, and supplies, to give the victims, because it is more efficient when it comes to getting the 
			supplies and delivering them to the victims. It is better for you to turn what you were thinking to donate into cash and donate the cash to a 
			worthy charity.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Be Careful Of Email Solicitations.</b></br>Please be wary of and delete any email solicitation from people claiming to be a victim 
			and especially any emails with attachments. Anyone claiming to be a victim is most likely part of a scam because anyone in a large scale disaster
			like a earthquake, hurricane or tsunami are in no position to contact you directly for assistance. Also any email with attachments most likely 
			full of viruses.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Seek Out The Charity’s Authorized Website.</b></br> After a disaster criminals and scammers are likely to set up bogus sites 
			to steal the identity and money of generous and unsuspecting individuals. If you plan to give online, 
			be sure to find the charity’s legitimate site. Most legitimate charity websites end with a .org and not a .com, and many scams use website names
			with letters or numbers at the end of the domain name extension (after the .com, .org, etc..).</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Consider The Nature Of The Charity’s Work.</b></br>Some charities provide medical assistance, some give shelter, and some give food and water. 
			Others will be more focused on either short term or long term rebuilding efforts. Some just fundraise for other nonprofits. 
			Think about what it is you want your investment to accomplish and then take the time to find the charities doing that work.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Be Inspired By Social Media, But Still Do Your Homework.</b></br>Social networking tools like Twitter, 
			Facebook, YouTube and blogs are useful to find out about a disaster, but they are not useful for finding charities to donate to.
			You must take the time to investigate the groups behind any plea from social media for help to ensure that it comes 
			from a legitimate nonprofit.</li></br>
			
			<li><b>Do Not Expect Immediate Results, But Do Keep Tabs On What Your Donation Accomplishes.</b></br>
			Change happens slowly and it takes time for charities to assess the problems that need to be addressed and to develop effective solutions.
			Be patient and don't pressure charities to hurry with their work or the charities may offer ineffective aid, but that doesn't mean you 
			shouldn't hold the charities accountable for delivering on their promises. Follow up with the charity in a few months to find out how your 
			donation was put to use and to see if they need additional support in the recovery effort.</li></br>
