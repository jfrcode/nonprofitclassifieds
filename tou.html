			<b>WELCOME TO CRAIGSLIST.</b> We hope you find it useful. By accessing our website 
			you agree to these Terms of Use ("TOU"), last updated December 05, 2013.
			</p>
			
			<p></br>
			<b>LICENSE.</b> If you are 18 or older, we grant you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive, nonassignable, nonsublicensable 
			license to access CL in compliance with the TOU; unlicensed access is unauthorized. You agree not to license, distribute,
			make derivative works, display, sell, or "frame" content from CL, excluding content you create and sharing with friends/family.
			You grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, unlimited, worldwide, fully paid/sublicensable license to use, copy, perform, display, 
			distribute, and make derivative works from content you post.
			</p>
			
			<p></br>
			<b>USE.</b> You agree not to use or provide software (except for general purpose web browsers and email clients, or software expressly
			licensed by us) or services that interact or interoperate with CL, e.g. for downloading, uploading, posting, flagging, emailing, 
			search, or mobile use. Robots, spiders, scripts, scrapers, crawlers, etc. are prohibited, as are misleading, unsolicited, unlawful,
			and/or spam postings/email. You agree not to collect users' personal and/or contact information ("PI").
			</p>
			
			<p></br>
			<b>MODERATION.</b> You agree we may moderate CL access and use in our sole discretion, e.g. by filtering, 
			deletion, delay, omission, verification, and/or access/license termination. You agree (1) not to bypass said moderation, 
			(2) we are not liable for moderating, not moderating, or representations as to moderating, and (3) nothing we say or do waives 
			our right to moderate, or not. All site rules, e.g. cl.com/prohibited, are incorporated herein.
			</p>
			
			<p></br>
			<b>DISCLAIMER. MANY JURISDICTIONS HAVE LAWS PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND OTHER CONTRACT PARTIES,
			LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TO WAIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. WE RESPECT SUCH LAWS;
			NOTHING HEREIN SHALL WAIVE RIGHTS OR RESPONSIBILITIES THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED.</b>
			</p>
			
			<p></br>
			To the extent permitted by law, (1) we make no promise as to CL, its completeness, accuracy, 
			availability, timeliness, propriety, security or reliability; (2) your access and use are at your own risk,
			and CL is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE"; (3) we are not liable for any harm resulting from (a) user content; 
			(b) user conduct, e.g. illegal conduct; (c) your CL use; or (d) our representations; (4) Any and all <b>CL ENTITIES, 
			DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES & CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR 
			PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; (5) CL ENTITIES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL 
			OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS (E.G. OF PROFIT, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL); (6) IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY 
			EXCEED $100.</b>
			</p>
			
			<p></br>
			<b>CLAIMS.</b> You agree (1) any claim, cause of action or dispute ("Claim") arising out of or related to the TOU or your CL 
			use is governed by Oregon ("OR") law regardless of your location or any conflict or choice of law principle; (2) 
			Claims must be resolved exclusively by state or federal court in Portland, OR (except we may seek injunctive remedy anywhere); 
			(3) to submit to personal jurisdiction of said courts; (4) any Claim must be filed by 1 year after it arose or be forever barred; 
			(5) not to bring or take part in a class action against CL Entities; (6) (except government agencies) to indemnify CL Entities for 
			any damage, loss, and expense (e.g. legal fees) arising from claims related to your CL use; (7) you are liable for TOU breaches by
			affiliates (e.g. marketers) paid by you, directly or indirectly (e.g. through an affiliate network); and (8) to pay us for breaching
			or inducing others to breach the "USE" section, not as a penalty, but as a reasonable estimate of our damages (actual damages are 
			often hard to calculate): $0.10 per server request, $1 per post, $1 per item of PI collected, and 
			$1000 per software distribution, capped at $25,000 per day.
			</p>
			
			<p></br>
			<b>MISC.</b> Users complying with prior written licenses may access CL thereby until authorization is terminated. Otherwise, 
			this is the exclusive and entire agreement between us. If a TOU term is unenforceable, other terms are unaffected.
			</p></br>
