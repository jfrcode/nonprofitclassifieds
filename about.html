			You have probably come here because you want to help the world or maybe you need some help. 
			Maybe you feel you don’t have a voice in this world. For what other reason or circumstance you might be 
			in you feel you can’t get any help or was unable to get any help from other people, government, and even from charities. 
			Maybe you are wealthy and people think that you either don’t need help, are able to afford it, or aren’t supposed to need help. 
			For people on the other end of the spectrum you may have tried to ask for money or help and in some cases people didn’t 
			trust you or something else prevented you from receiving help. Maybe you are just shy and are fearful of what people 
			think of you if you ask for help. It doesn’t matter who you are and what your economic or social status is. 
			If you need help and feel that you don’t have a voice to ask for help then Craigslist can give you that voice. 
			You can anonymously post an ad saying you need help. Whether it is help in finding a home, a shoulder to cry on, 
			food, basic resources, or more, you can post an advertisement saying what you need help with. You can also see what 
			other people need help with and help them. Charities also can post things on here too. If a charity needs donations 
			or volunteers they can ask for it here and they can also show the world how they can help. This site allows everyone 
			the opportunity of giving help to those in need. It allows everyone to put aside what holds them back and lets them be 
			heard, but it also allows me to be heard.
